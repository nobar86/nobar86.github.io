</p>The million dollar question here is why I chose Software Engineering. Well, it's because my passion for technology.
I have built computers, maintained computers, worked with computers, and now I want to know what makes them tick.
I have always been intrigued by computer languages because of their elegance and complexity and I have always been a sucker for a good challenge, and what better way to challenge myself than to learn a new language(s). My dream is to one day own my own video game company or at the very least work for one, and becoming a Software Engineer is the first step in making my dream a reality. If I could achieve this goal, I would not only love what I do for a living, but I would also be able to support my family. I have a beautiful wife and two amazing boys who have given me their full support in accomplishing this dream of mine. I would not have come this far if it weren't for them.

 </p>I know that this journey will take me down many difficult paths, but in my eyes, that only makes the prize at the end of the journey that much sweeter. I love the fact that I get to enjoy this journey with so many great people in my cohort. It is not very often that you find a group of people so eager and willing to help you and I truly appreciate each and every one of the people I have had the pleasure of meeting so far along this journey. I am looking forward to working with many more of the people in my cohort, because networking is very important, especially in this world.

</p>Until next time, later guys!
