`As my title suggests, my CLI project is about game of Thrones. I am completely infatuated with that show, except for the 8th season which was an utter disappointment. Anyways, the reason I went with this subject as my CLI project is because I am a huge fanboy of the series. I originally wanted to do my project on Dragonball Z however, I ran into a good many issues with the API that was available for that show. I am also completely obsessed with that show as well, but since the Game of Thrones API provided me with better data, I decided to change my project to Game of Thrones instead of Dragonball Z. This was a difficult decision for me to make seeing as how I almost had most of the project done when I figured out that I was going to need to switch topics. It's all good though becuase I got the project done and I am quite pleased with the end result!`

`The most challenging aspect of this project I ran into was getting the correct URL for my API. I tried som many different URL's, but none of them were giving me the results that I wanted to display to my users. I did encounter a few more hiccups along the way such as: getting the correct syntax for certain methods, getting all my classes to talk to one another, and figuring out how to display an array as a string, which I found out from a fellow cohort is .join. Other than these few issues, the rest of the project went fairly smooth. So now I have a fully functional program that I hope my users will enjoy.`

```
I had a really great time working on this project and trying to figure out my issues and debugging my program. I was able to accomplish finishing this project because I have great teachers and excellent cohort members who helped me along the way. I could not have done this without you guys. Thank you very much for all the help, support, and encouragement that pushed me to the finish line! I am looking forward to the rest of the projects we have remaining in this cohort and the challenges that they bring. 
```

`Until next time...`
